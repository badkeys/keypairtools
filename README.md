Vulnerable version of keypair plus script to generate vulnerable keys

> :warning: **This contains vulnerable code, only use for testing/analysis!**

This repository contains scripts to generate keys with the javascript `keypair` package
vulnerable to CVE-2021-41117.

The vulnerable keypair version creates predictable and often duplicate keys.

`kpscript.js` creates a single vulnerable key with a random filename.

`genkeys.sh` creates an output directory with prefix out and a random name and will then
run an endless loop of `kpscript.js` in that directory.
